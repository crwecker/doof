API server for writinator

`ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i <path to pem> ubuntu@<instance address>`
At least on my computer, I have enough ssh keys that if I don't do IdentitiesOnly to tell it to use the one in the command, the server connection fails on trying other keys before it gets to the one I add.
